In addition to the collaborative methods compared in the main manuscript, we further evaluated the success rate differences between the proposed CoDrivingLLM and single-vehicle decision-making approaches. Specifically, we selected the rule-based Projected Intelligent Driver Model (PIDM), the optimization-based Non-Cooperative Game, the reinforcement learning-based PPO, and TeLL, which integrates reinforcement learning with large models, as representative algorithms for single-vehicle decision-making.

| Success rate | 25% | 50% | 11% | 52% | 90%* |
